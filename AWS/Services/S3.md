## Bucket and Object Access Control

There are [five mechanisms](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/) for controlling access to Amazon S3 resources:

* IAM Policies
* Bucket Policies
* ACLs
* Access Points
* Query String Authentication

These five mechanisms fall under one of [three categories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html):

* User Policies
* Resource-based Policies
* REST API

You can also use the [Block Public Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html) group of settings for S3 buckets.

For a summary of when to use User Policies or Resource-based Policies, see [this blog article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/iam-policies-and-bucket-policies-and-acls-oh-my-controlling-access-to-s3-resources/).

### User Policies

[User Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-policies-s3.html) are access policies you attach to [IAM Users, Groups, or Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) in your AWS account. These policies are called IAM Policies.

IAM Policies are [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) using a User Policy assigned to the IAM User or Group.

### Resource-based Policies

Resource-based Policies are access policies you attach to your resources (buckets and objects).

There are three types of Resource-based Policies:

* [Bucket Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html) configured on the [S3 Bucket Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-bucket-policy.html).
* [Access Control Lists (ACLs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) which were created prior to IAM Policies and are configured through the [S3 Bucket ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/set-bucket-permissions.html).
* [Access Points](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/access-points/) are unique hostnames that customers create to enforce distinct permissions and network controls

### REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)

Using the REST APIs you can use [Query String Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) which is also called [Presigned Object URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html).

With Query String Authentication, you can create a URL to an Amazon S3 object which is only valid for a limited time.

You will find the Query String Authentication access control mechanism mainly used by software packages.
